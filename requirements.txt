# pyannote.audio will pull torch, torchaudio, and other dependencies.
# Ensure you install a version compatible with your Python and CUDA (if using GPU)
# For example, for pyannote.audio 2.x or 3.x:
pyannote.audio>=3.1
# For torch, it's often better to install it separately based on your system (CPU/GPU)
# e.g., pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 (for CUDA 11.8)
# or pip install torch torchaudio (for CPU version)
# The pyannote.audio dependency usually handles a compatible torch version, but check its docs.
# If you encounter issues, try installing torch and torchaudio manually first.
# Example:
# torch>=2.0.0
# torchaudio>=2.0.0
